        ques: "What is an X-ray?",
        ans: `An X-ray is a type of medical imaging that uses radiation to take pictures of the inside of your body. 
Most people use the term “X-ray” to mean a plain radiograph (plain film), or just one image. But X-rays are also the type of radiation that imaging machines use to create pictures. X-ray radiation is also used in other types of medical imaging, like CT scans, to get many images that are interpreted by a computer to form 3D pictures. This piece will focus on plain X-rays.

        ques: "How do I prepare for an X-ray?",
        ans: `Preparation for an X-ray depends on the type of X-ray you’re getting. Your provider may ask you to:
Avoid using lotions, creams or perfume. These can cause shadows on your X-rays and make the results inaccurate.
Remove metal objects like jewelry, hairpins or hearing aids. Metal can interfere with X-rays and make the results inaccurate.
Stop eating or drinking several hours beforehand.
Wear comfortable clothing or change into a gown before the X-ray.
Tell your healthcare provider about your health history, allergies and any medications you’re taking. If you’re pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are breastfeeding (chestfeeding), tell your provider before getting an X-ray. If you’re getting an X-ray with contrast, let your provider know if you have a kidney condition.

        ans: `<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:13px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 17px;">Ultrasound is a non-invasive scan which uses high frequency sound waves of the inside of your body. During your private Ultrasound scan, a probe is passed over the skin and this emits sound waves. These sound waves bounce off your organs and send a signal via the microphone to the computer which then displays the sound as an image.</span></p>

        ans: `<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:13px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 17px;">The steps you will take to prepare for an ultrasound will depend on the area or organ that is being examined.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:13px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 17px;">Your doctor may tell you to fast for 4 to 6 hours before your ultrasound, especially if your abdomen is being examined. Undigested food can block the sound waves, making it difficult for the technician to get a clear picture.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:13px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 17px;">For an examination of the gallbladder, liver, pancreas, or spleen, you may be told to eat a fat-free meal the evening before your test and then to fast until the procedure. However, you can continue to drink water and take any medications as instructed. For other examinations, you may be asked to drink a lot of water and to hold your urine so that your bladder is full and better visualized.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:13px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 17px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:13px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size: 17px;">As Ultrasound scans use high frequency sound waves, they are an extremely safe and convenient procedure. The patient is fully awake during the procedure and no discomfort is experienced.</span></strong></p>`,
