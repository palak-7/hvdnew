                  What is 24-Hour Holter Monitoring?
                </h1>

                <p className="text-lg mt-2 flex">
                  24-hour Holter monitoring is a type of continuous ECG
                  (electrocardiogram) that records the electrical activity of
                  your heart over a full 24-hour period. It involves wearing a
                  small, portable device with electrodes attached to your chest.
                  The device monitors your heartâ€™s rhythm, detecting
                  irregularities such as arrhythmias, palpitations, or other
                  issues that may not show up during a standard ECG test. Holter
                  monitoring is useful for diagnosing heart conditions and
                  evaluating symptoms like dizziness, chest pain, or fainting.
                  The data collected during the 24 hours is later analyzed by a
                  doctor to assess heart health.
